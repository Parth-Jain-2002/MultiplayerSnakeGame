Improvenment to be done in some of the aspects of the game:-
1) On some devices, the code isn't flashed. Maybe due to CORS issue, calling from one site to another. 
2) As soon as the game finishes, there is no way to reset the game.
3) The snake has no clear head, so its difficult at the beginning of the game to identify where it is pointing.
4) As soon as the snake touches the wall, it should be stop. But presently, that is not happening
